# .icns_icon_builder
BASH shellscript that builds .icns icon files from .png image files    

NOTES
Not tested on any other type of image file. Or any other file for that matter!
For best results, use image resolution 1024x1024
Uses absolute paths. Be careful of paths that contain not stand characters such as '!'

---- Usage -----
run the shell then drag and drop file into the terminal
the shell spits out a fully functioning .icns icon file ready for distribution / compile etc
